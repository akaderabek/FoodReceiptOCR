# FoodReceiptOCR
Repository of files related to the use of novel OCR processing of point-of-sale receipts as a method for data collection in expenditure research.

The R files associated with this project were developed to evidence the ability of using the open source Tesseract OCR engine to read point-of-sale (POS) receipts which evidence food purchases. The goal of this research was to evidence novel OCR processes as a method to estimate under reporting in surveys of expenditure research.

The process included three main processes, first the pre-processing of receipt images using ImageMagick, secondly the OCR of the image using Tesseract, and lastly the parsing of scanned test into an analytical format; i.e., a digital replica of the receipt.
